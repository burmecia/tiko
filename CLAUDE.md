# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pico replaces PostgreSQL's magnetic disk (`md`) storage manager with S3-backed block storage. A local file cache sits in front of S3 as the source of truth. The project is written in Rust and compiled as PostgreSQL shared libraries (extensions).

## Build & Test

Requires Rust 1.88+ (edition 2024). PostgreSQL is a git submodule under `postgres/`.

```bash
# Build everything and run tests
./run_test.sh

# Build individual crates
cd s3smgr && cargo build --release    # produces target/release/libs3smgr.a (staticlib)
cd s3worker && cargo build --release  # produces target/release/libs3worker.dylib (cdylib)

# Run the PostgreSQL regression test
cd postgres/src/test/modules/test_pico && make check \
  PG_TEST_INITDB_EXTRA_OPTS='-c log_min_messages=debug1 -c shared_preload_libraries=libs3worker'
```

PostgreSQL configure (from `note.txt`) — minimal debug build:
```bash
cd postgres && ./configure --prefix $(realpath ../)/target/pg-install \
    --enable-debug --enable-cassert --without-openssl --without-systemd \
    --without-libxml --without-libxslt --without-llvm --without-selinux
```

## Architecture

Three workspace crates with a clear dependency chain:

```
s3smgr ──→ s3worker ──→ pgsys
  │                       │
  └───────────────────────┘
```

### `pgsys` — PostgreSQL FFI bindings
Raw `extern "C"` declarations for PG internals: smgr (md* functions), background workers, shared memory, LWLocks, latches, condition variables, logging. No build.rs/bindgen — bindings are hand-written `#[repr(C)]` structs matching PG's C layout. Symbols resolve at load time against the running postgres process.

### `s3smgr` — Storage manager interface (staticlib)
Implements the PG `smgr` interface with `s3_*` functions (`s3_readv`, `s3_writev`, `s3_open`, etc.) that are registered as the storage manager. Two I/O paths:

- **Sync path** (all smgr functions except `s3_startreadv` and `s3_prefetch`): Calls `s3_ops` directly in the backend process (`pread`/`pwrite` on local cache files). This is correct because sync smgr callers may pass backend-local memory pointers (`PageSetChecksumCopy` palloc'd pages, `LocalBufferBlockPointers`, stack-local `PGIOAlignedBlock`) that s3worker cannot access cross-process.
- **Async path** (`s3_startreadv` → `s3_io_perform_read`/`s3_io_perform_write`): Uses the shared-memory pipeline to s3worker. Buffers are always in shared memory (`BufferBlocks`), so cross-process access is safe. Also used by `s3_prefetch` for local cache warming (no `buffer_ptr`).

The `use_pipeline()` helper (combines `is_under_postmaster()` + `is_s3worker_alive()`) guards the async path in `aio.rs` and `prefetch.rs`, falling back to direct `s3_ops` when unavailable (initdb, shutdown checkpoint, s3worker crash).

### `s3worker` — Background worker process (cdylib)
Loaded via `shared_preload_libraries`. `_PG_init` registers a background worker that calls `s3worker_main`. Internal structure:
- **`main_loop`** — the PG-process main thread: polls submit queue, dispatches to Tokio, sleeps via `WaitLatch`
- **`thread_pool`** — initializes Tokio runtime (4 async workers + 8 blocking threads)
- **`dispatcher`** — bounded `sync_channel` for work requests from main thread to Tokio (no completion channel — Tokio notifies backends directly via SetLatch)
- **`io_handler`** — async S3 GET/PUT and local cache read/write with SetLatch completion path
- **`io_queue`** (pub) — the shared memory data structures, also used by `s3smgr`
- **`s3_ops`** (pub) — synchronous block-level file I/O (`read_blocks`, `write_blocks`, `create_file`, etc.). Called directly by s3smgr sync functions and by s3worker's `io_handler`. Uses S3-style path layout: `{DataDir}/pico/{spc_oid}/{db_oid}/{rel_number}.{fork}`
- **`shmem`** — hooks into `shmem_request_hook`/`shmem_startup_hook` for PG shared memory init

### Shared Memory IPC

`S3IoControl` lives in PG shared memory (allocated via `ShmemInitStruct`). Layout:

- **Per-backend slot pools** (`BackendSlotPool`): Each backend owns 4 `S3IoSlot`s (64 bytes each). Slot claiming uses a local bitmask — zero contention, no CAS races. Pools are dynamically sized to `MaxBackends` and follow `S3IoControl` in shared memory via pointer arithmetic.
- **MPSC submit queue** (`SubmitQueue`): Backends push `(backend_id, slot_idx)` entries via `fetch_add`. s3worker pops and dispatches. Strict ordering, no advisory hints. 1024 entries, power-of-2 ring buffer. Zero sentinel handles producer write delays.
- **SetLatch completion**: Tokio workers call `SetLatch(owner_latch)` directly on the backend's latch after marking a slot Completed. No harvest step, no main-thread scan.

### Slot State Machine

`Free → Filling → Submitted → InProgress → Completed → Free`

| Transition | Who | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Free → Filling | Backend | Claim from own pool (bit clear) |
| Filling → Submitted | Backend | `slot.publish()` (Release store) |
| Submitted → InProgress | s3worker | `slot.try_start_processing()` (CAS) |
| InProgress → Completed | Tokio | `slot.mark_completed()` + `SetLatch(owner_latch)` |
| Completed → Free | Backend | `slot.release()` + `pool.release()` |

### Shutdown & Non-Normal Mode Handling

PostgreSQL kills all `B_BG_WORKER` processes (including s3worker) in `PM_STOP_BACKENDS`, **before** the checkpointer performs the shutdown checkpoint in `PM_WAIT_XLOG_SHUTDOWN`. There is no `bgw_flags` value to keep a bgworker alive past this phase.

**`use_pipeline()` guard** (used in `aio.rs` and `prefetch.rs`):
- `is_under_postmaster()` — false during initdb (both `--boot` and `--single` phases). Checked via PG's `IsUnderPostmaster` global (process-local, no shared memory).
- `is_s3worker_alive()` — uses `kill(pid, 0)` on PID stored in shared memory. Returns false if s3worker is dead (shutdown, crash).
- When `use_pipeline()` returns false, the AIO path falls back to direct `s3_ops` calls (same as the sync smgr functions).

All sync smgr functions (`s3_readv`, `s3_writev`, `s3_extend`, `s3_create`, etc.) always call `s3_ops` directly — no pipeline, no fallback needed. This handles initdb, shutdown checkpoint, and s3worker crash. Pages land in the local cache (persistent), WAL guarantees recoverability, and on next startup s3worker reconciles cache-dirty pages with S3.

### PG18 AIO Integration

PG18 introduces an asynchronous I/O subsystem built around `PgAioHandle` — a shared-memory object tracking each I/O operation through a state machine: `IDLE → HANDED_OUT → DEFINED → STAGED → SUBMITTED → COMPLETED_IO → COMPLETED_SHARED → COMPLETED_LOCAL → IDLE`. The smgr interface adds `startreadv` alongside the existing synchronous `readv`.

**Design: Custom `PgAioOp` for S3 reads**

Add `PGAIO_OP_S3_READV` to the `PgAioOp` enum and handle it in `pgaio_io_perform_synchronously()`. This plugs into PG18 AIO with a small, contained patch — no I/O method replacement, no custom callbacks needed.

**Data flow:**

                       ConditionVariableBroadcast
wref_wait returns ◄──┘
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **No `PGAIO_HF_SYNCHRONOUS` flag**: Without this flag, `pgaio_io_stage` submits the handle to PG's IO worker pool (not the backend). The IO worker calls `pgaio_io_perform_synchronously()` which hits our `PGAIO_OP_S3_READV` switch case. The backend remains non-blocking — true async from its perspective.
- **IO worker reuses `submit_and_wait()`**: The IO worker is a regular PG process with a valid `MyProcNumber` and `MyLatch`, counted in `MaxBackends`. It gets its own `BackendSlotPool` in `S3IoControl`. From Pico's perspective, it's just another backend — claims slots, publishes requests, waits on latch. No Tokio runtime needed in the IO worker.
- **s3worker handles all S3 I/O**: The IO worker never touches S3 directly. It submits to the Pico shared-memory pipeline; s3worker's Tokio runtime handles cache checks, S3 fetches, and writes data to the shared-memory buffer pages.
- **Bufmgr callbacks work unmodified**: `pgaio_io_process_completion` runs the normal callback chain (md byte validation, bufmgr `BM_VALID` flag setting, checksum checks) — no custom AIO callbacks needed.

**PG patch scope** (~6 switch cases + 1 function + enum update):

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `include/storage/aio.h` | Add `PGAIO_OP_S3_READV` to `PgAioOp`, update `PGAIO_OP_COUNT` |
| `aio_io.c` `pgaio_io_perform_synchronously` | Add case calling `s3_io_perform_read()` |
| `aio_io.c` `pgaio_io_get_op_name` | Add `"s3_readv"` |
| `aio_io.c` `pgaio_io_uses_fd` | Return `false` (no fd to track) |
| `aio_io.c` `pgaio_io_get_iovec_length` | Return from `op_data.read.iov_length` |
| `aio_io.c` | Add `pgaio_io_start_s3_readv()` (sets up op_data, calls `pgaio_io_stage`) |
| `aio_funcs.c` `pg_get_aios` | Display offset/length for debug view |
| `method_io_uring.c` | Not needed — IO worker path handles it via `pgaio_io_perform_synchronously` |

**Rust side** (`s3smgr`):

- `s3_startreadv`: Set up iovec from buffers, register md callbacks, set smgr target, call `pgaio_io_start_s3_readv()`
- `s3_io_perform_read` (`extern "C"`): Decode relation info from `target_data`, call `submit_and_wait()` with iov buffer addresses, return `nblocks * BLCKSZ` or `-errno`

### Future Improvements

- **Local cache hit short-circuit**: Cache hits bypass the shared memory queue entirely — `s3_readv` checks the cache index and does a direct `pread()`. Only cache misses go through the async pipeline.
- **S3 request coalescing**: Batch adjacent block reads into single S3 range GET requests to amortize per-request latency.

### Thread Safety Rules

Tokio threads **CAN**: read/write shared memory atomics, `memcpy` to `buffer_ptr`, file/network I/O, `SetLatch`.
Tokio threads **CANNOT**: call `ConditionVariable*`, `LWLock*`, `ereport`/`elog`, `palloc`/`pfree` — these require PG process-local state and must only run on the main thread.

## Key Conventions

- `s3worker/build.rs` uses `-undefined dynamic_lookup` (macOS) so PG symbols resolve at extension load time
- All PG-facing functions use `extern "C-unwind"` and `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`
- Shared memory pointers stored in `OnceLock<*mut T>` with Send/Sync wrapper types
- PG hook chaining: always save and call `prev_*_hook` before installing custom hooks
